# Advanced Creative Coding - WebGL Final Project

Length: Two Weeks

# Description

Concept: My final project will be a virtual claw machine game. With the joystick module, the player can control the claw's direction on the x and z planes, then with the press of a button the claw will deploy in an attempt to retrieve a prize.

# 2 Week Sprint
- week one: create stage, claw, and prizes
    - use blender, illustrator, or readily available 3D models
- week two: incorporate arduino functionality

# Anticipated Challenges
- importing/creating customized objects (getting permission too)
- stage design
- physical object manipulation
- MVC
